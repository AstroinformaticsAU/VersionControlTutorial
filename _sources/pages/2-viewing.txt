Viewing and comparing commits
=============================

The commit history
------------------

The command ``git log`` displays the commit history of the current branch.  If
you try it in your ``dummy_paper`` directory you should see something like the
following::

    commit 98cdaf38c12fccbfe92d4f15dc869afc12792b22
    Author: Simon Mutch <smutch@unimelb.edu.au>
    Date:   Sat Feb 16 15:56:41 2013 +1100

        Delete bibliography.tex.

    commit cc745dbfdf0421c7d84d72c75d3a52c517665fe7
    Author: Simon Mutch <smutch@unimelb.edu.au>
    Date:   Sat Feb 16 15:54:55 2013 +1100

        Add another section, appendix.tex and bibliography.tex.

    commit f615b15149a633c47f690bf891e39cb80029a71b
    Author: Simon Mutch <smutch@unimelb.edu.au>
    Date:   Sat Feb 16 15:51:06 2013 +1100

        Add basic structure of paper.tex

As you can see ``git log`` provides the unique reference (SHA-1 checksum) for
each commit, the author name and email address, as well as the date and commit
message.  The entries are listed in reverse chronological order (i.e.  the most
recent commit first).

There are a whole host of flags and arguments you can pass to ``git log`` to
change what information is presented and how it looks.  For example, try typing::

    % git log --pretty=format:"%h %s <%an>" --graph

The result should be something like this::

    * 98cdaf3 Delete bibliography.tex. <Simon Mutch>
    * cc745db Add another section, appendix.tex and bibliography.tex. <Simon Mutch>
    * f615b15 Add basic structure of paper.tex <Simon Mutch>

To investigate all the different options for formatting your log output, try
looking at the help for the ``log`` command::

    % git help log

.. tip::

    ``git help <command>`` can be used to get the documentation for almost every
    Git command.  If you type ``git help`` on it's own, you will also be
    presented with a list of all major commands for reference.

Its useful to be able to have this concise view of the log without having to
type the long command every time.  We can achieve this by adding the command as
an alias.  Try this command::

    % git config --global alias.lg 'log --pretty=format:"%h %s <%an>" --graph'  

Now you can get the concise log view by simply typing::

    % git lg


Comparing commits
-----------------

Often we want to compare (or "difference") commits to see how things have
changed.  To do this we use the ``git diff`` command.  For example, to see how
our paper has changed between the most recent commit and our first commit **I**
would type::

    % git diff ef5ca0a

Your commit reference will be different to mine however, and so you must
substitute the appropriate reference in place of ``ef5ca0a``.  Remember, you
can get this reference using the ``git lg`` command as outlined above.

.. highlight:: diff

Once you run ``git diff`` successfully, you will see something like this::

    diff --git c/appendix.tex w/appendix.tex
    new file mode 100644
    index 0000000..e69de29
    diff --git c/paper.tex w/paper.tex
    index 3290236..599a0b6 100644
    --- c/paper.tex
    +++ w/paper.tex
    @@ -8,5 +8,8 @@
     \section{Introduction}
     A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...
     
    +\section{A New Hope}
    +That's no moon, that's a battle station.
    +
     \end{document}

.. highlight:: console

The ``+`` signs show text which has been added since our first commit, and any
``-`` signs would indicate text which has been removed.  At the top of the diff,
we can also see that we have added the ``appendix.tex`` file.

By specifying only one commit reference when calling ``git diff`` we actually
implicitly ran::

    % git diff ef5ca0a..HEAD

``HEAD`` is a shortcut for the commit reference pointing to the most recent
relevant commit.  To access the second most recent commit we can use the
shortcut ``^HEAD``.  These shortcuts are handy to remember when comparing
commits.

``git diff`` can also be used to see how the current state of files have changed
since the last commit.  To do this simply run the command with no arguments.


.. topic:: Exercise 2a

    Add a sentence to the section "A New Hope" of ``paper.tex`` but don't
    commit the change.  Now try running::

        % git diff

    and make sure you understand the results.


Another useful way to view the commit history of your repository is to use the
``gitk`` GUI program which is packaged with Git.  This program displays both the
commit history and relevant diffs all together.

Playing the blame game
----------------------

Another useful way to visualise the history to is to look at a single file and
see in which commit each line was last changed.  Imagine that we identified a
bug in a line of code.  We could then use this technique to see how long ago
that bug was introduced (and by who!).  Try this::

    % git blame paper.tex --date=relative

and you should see a copy of ``paper.tex`` with the reference, author and time
of the last commit where each line was modified.
