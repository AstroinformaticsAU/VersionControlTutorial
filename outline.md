# Abstract

This session will introduce the concept of version control and its particular importance for researchers.  We will also try out some practical examples using the [Git](http://git-scm.com/) version control system that will include some of the following topics: 

- basic usage (creating a repository, adding files, committing changes)
- branches
- sharing and collaboration
- merging and conflicts
- online hosting


# Introduction

## What is version control?

- Basically a system to record changes to files (/documents) and folders.
- You probably already use some form of version control but may not realise it...
	- Built in to MS Word, Keynote, Dropbox etc.
	
Version control is commonly used to manage source code, however, it is also well suited to tracking changes to any kind of file which contains mostly text.  It can also be used by a lone developer or as a means for many people to share and collaborate on projects efficiently and safely.
