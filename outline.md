# Abstract

This session will introduce the concept of version control and its particular importance for researchers.  We will also try out some practical examples using the [Git](http://git-scm.com/) version control system that will include some of the following topics: 

- basic usage (creating a repository, adding files, committing changes)
- branches
- sharing and collaboration
- merging and conflicts
- online hosting



# NOTES.todo

- Remember to use best practices paper
- Add video of Linus saying why we should use Git



# Introduction

## What is version control?

- Basically a system to record changes to files (/documents) and folders.
- You probably already use some form of version control but may not realise it...
	- Built in to MS Word, Keynote, Dropbox etc.
	
Version control is commonly used to manage source code, however, it is also well suited to tracking changes to any kind of file which contains mostly text.  It can also be used by a lone developer or as a means for many people to share and collaborate on projects efficiently and safely.


## Why you should use it (for everything)

In important aspect of any scientific endeavour is **reproducibility**.  We should be able to replicate every figure we have ever publish, even if we have significantly developed our codes and tools in the mean time. 

As astronomers, we spend much of our time writing code, whether it be a simulation code or a observational reduction pipeline.  As such, our codes are often constantly evolving.  By putting all of our code under version control we can:

- Record the reference of the exact code version that produced a particular plot or result.
- Roll back our code to previous states.
- Identify when/how bugs were introduced.
- Efficiently share and collaborate on our codes with others.

Many of these are also useful when writing papers.  Here we can use version control to 

- Bring back that paragraph we accidentally deleted last week.
- Try out a different structure and simply disregard it if we don't like it.
- Concurrently work on a paper with a collaborator and then automatically merge all of our updates together.

The upshot is **you should use version control for almost everything**.  The benefits are well worth it...
