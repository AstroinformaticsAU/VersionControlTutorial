These are the course notes for the **Version Control** session of the `2013 ASA/ANITA Astroinformatics Summer School <http://www.smp.uq.edu.au/anitaworkshop2013/?page_id=30>`_.

This session introduces the concept of version control and its particular
importance for researchers.  We will also try out some practical examples using
the `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ version control system and touch on the
following topics: 

- basic usage (creating a repository, adding files, committing changes)
- branches
- merging and conflicts
- online hosting and collaboration
