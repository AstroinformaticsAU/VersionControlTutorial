What is version control?
------------------------

Version control, a.k.a. revision control / source code management, is basically
a system for recording and managing changes made to files and folders.  It is
commonly used to manage source code, however, it is also well suited to
tracking changes to any kind of file which contains mostly text.  It can also
be used by a lone developer or as a means for many people to share and
collaborate on projects efficiently and safely.

Chances are, you already employ your own version control system, even if you
don't realise it...  Many modern editors such as Microsoft Word and Apple Pages
have this facility built in.  Also Dropbox maintains a full history of all of
the files you have deletes and edited during the last month. 

You have almost certainly employed your own simple form of a version control
system in the past.  Here is an example:

This image shows the files and folders making up a paper fictitious paper
submission.  There are a number of saved copies of the final ``article.tex``
which have created incrementally as the paper has been written, redrafted and
submitted.  These are called **revisions**.  By looking at any of these
revisions we are able to see the state of the paper as it was when the revision
file was saved.  By comparing revision files we can also get a rough idea of
how the paper developed and changed as it was written.  Of course, the more
saved revisions we have, the easier it is to piece together how things changed
over time.
