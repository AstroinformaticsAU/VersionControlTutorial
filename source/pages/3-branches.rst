Branches
========

What is a branch?
------------------

Branches allow you to diverge from your current development and try something
new without altering the history of your main work.  For example, you could
implement a new code feature whilst leaving the fully functional (hopefully
working and tested) code intact for others to checkout.

In Git, branching is generally quick, flexible and simple.  It is a fantastic
way to test out ideas, try new things and safely develop your repository.  This
is especially true when collaborating with other people...


Creating branches
-----------------

All new repositories, by default, start on a branch called ``master`` (you
should see this name if you again run ``git status``).

Let's now create a new branch called ``risky_idea`` by typing the following
command inside of our ``dummy_paper`` directory::

    % git branch risky_idea

Well that was simple!  However, if a quick check of ``git status`` shows that we
are still on the ``master`` branch.  In order to start working with our new
branch we need to perform a ``checkout``; This moves our current "HEAD"
(remember this is what Git calls the pointer to the most recent relevant commit)
to the branch ``risky_idea``::

    % git checkout risky_idea

Running ``git status`` now should show that you are on the ``risky_idea``
branch.

Now run::

    % git log

and you should see that our earlier commits from the ``master`` branch are still
there.  When running ``git branch``, the newly created branch inherits the
history of the original branch we diverged from (in this case the ``master``
branch).  However, any subsequent commits to the new branch will not exist in
the original.

    Add another section to ``master.tex`` with the following::
    
        \section{The Empire Strikes Back}
        Laugh it up fuzz-ball!...
    
    .. highlight:: console

    Then stage and commit your changes.  Finally, compare the ``risky_idea``
    branch with the tip of the ``master`` branch using ``git diff``::

        % git diff master
