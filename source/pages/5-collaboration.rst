Online hosting and collaboration
================================

As well as managing our own codes and documents, another important use of
version control is for collaboration...

Online hosting
--------------

As already discussed (:ref:`here <git_intro>`), Git uses a "distributed" model
that allows everyone working on a project to have their own independent copy of
the entire repository.  At some point though, you will want to have a central
version of the code base which is used to unify everyones' efforts.

Typically the best place for such a central repository is online.
