Other great tutorials and resources for learning Git include:

- The Git Pro book (`<http://git-scm.com/book>`_)

GUI clients
-----------

See the `list <http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>`_ on the Git homepage for a
good run down on the different options here. 


Miscelaneous
------------

If your feeling adventurous, try learning Git with `Githug
<https://github.com/Gazler/githug>`_.

If your looking for an excellent command line Git client try `Tig
<http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/>`_.

If you use Vim then I can't recommend enough the `Fugitive
<https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive>`_ plugin.
